2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ensure fresh state
3. **Test Run**: Do a 30-second test recording
4. **Check Audio**: Verify microphone is working
5. **Prepare Notes**: Have demo script open in another window

### During Recording

1. **Speak Clearly**: Enunciate, moderate pace
2. **Use Cursor**: Point to important elements
3. **Pause When Needed**: It's okay to pause and think
4. **Show Errors Gracefully**: If something fails, explain what should happen
5. **Stay Calm**: Take deep breaths between sections

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Speaking too fast
- ❌ Not explaining what you're doing
- ❌ Skipping important features
- ❌ Not showing the code/architecture
- ❌ Rushing through the demo
- ❌ Forgetting to show error handling

## Post-Recording

### Editing (Optional)

2. **Add Titles**: Add section titles if helpful
3. **Speed Up**: Slightly speed up slow sections (1.25x)
4. **Add Captions**: Consider adding subtitles

## Backup Plan

If recording fails or has issues:

3. **Written Walkthrough**: Provide detailed written explanation
4. **Live Demo**: Offer to do a live demo if possible

- **Maximum**: 12 minutes (if needed)
- **Minimum**: 7 minutes (if concise)

Breakdown:
- Intro: 30s
- Problem: 60s

**Remember**: The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of the system, not perfection. It's okay to make minor mistakes - just explain what should happen.

Good luck! 🎥
